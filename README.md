To run the code, copy and paste the code or open the code in a compilor like pycharm. Make sure to have the wine dataset in the directory you are working from.
Included are a few plots from running the code. 

Advanced: The pairplot is the best plot for me because it gives me a chance to look at all the possible combonations features on a scatter and that way I can easily pick the ones that are of interest.
